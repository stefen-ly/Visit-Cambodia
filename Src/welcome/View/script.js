                description: "In Cambodia, Khmer New Year is the greatest traditional festival, and also the greatest national holiday.  It is three days of festival and sometimes can be four days. Khmer New Year begins on April 13th or can begin on April 14th, depending on the “MohaSangkran,” which is the ancient horoscope. In fact, Khmer New Year originally began on the first day of the first month in the lunar calendar, which can be in November or the beginning of December. In the Angkor Era, the 13th Century, the Khmer King, either Suriyavaraman II or Jayavaraman VII, changed the New Year to the fifth month of the lunar calendar, in April by the solar calendar.",

            "The first day of New Year is called Moha Sangkran, and it can be described simply as the inauguration of the New Angels who come to take care of the world for a one-year period. The leader of Angels is named “KimiteaTevi. People need to clean and decorate the house and also prepare fruits and drinks for the New Year inauguration and to welcome the New Angels at every single home. ",
            "The second day of New Year is called Wanabot, which means day of offering gifts to the parents, grandparents and elders. Usually, Khmer People like to share gifts or presents to employees and also donate money or clothes to poor people. In the evening, people go to temple to build a mountain of sand and ask the monks to give them a blessing of happiness and peace.",
            "The third day is called day of “Leung Sakk;” that means the year starts to be counted up from this day, for example it is when the year of 2000 would change and begin to be 2001.  Traditionally, in the morning, people would go to the temple to perform the ceremony of the mountain of sand to get blessed. In the evening, to complete the New Year festival, Khmer people need to perform the last ceremony, called “Pithi Srang Preah”, which means giving a special bath or a special shower to Buddha statues, the monks, elders, parents and grandparents in order to apologize for any mistake done to them and to gratify them. Everyone has a wonderful time during this ceremony because it is a great opportunity for everyone, young and old, man and woman, to have much fun by spreading out water to each other."

            "The people of Cambodia believe that after death they become ghosts whose earthly actions shape their appearance and that they walk the earth at this time. The living eases our suffering by offering them food. We also make offerings of money, dresses and other items to the monks in the temples. All Khmers are also offered food and drink. The offerings made are shared by the poor and the disabled during Pchum Ben and the donors acquire merit and cancel out past sins.",
            "In the morning at 8:00 AM, people come to the temple, with offerings for the monks. They bring money and other things as well. At 10:00 the people return with more food, which will be shared between monks and poor people. Many of the Buddhist traditions seem to relate to feeding the poor. Disabled people also crowd around the temple tat is hour, begging alms. To give help to the less-fortunate, particularly during Pchum Ben, is to acquire merit. Between 5:00-7:00 PM there will be more prayers for the dead. People would be coming back to the temple at 4:00 the next morning because we have to toss the rice ball to our ancestors so we have to be up at 3:00.",
            "One of the reasons the monks are offered gifts is because the Buddha commanded the monks to remain indoors for three months praying and meditating and hence food had to be given by outsiders. In the past, crops were planted inside the temple grounds and the young plants would die if monks walked about, hence they were told to remain indoors. This was the time to concentrate and purify the minds, by engaging in meditation. People are told to abstain from alcohol and behave well, and the monks are secluded, because if they failed, they would not get any offerings during the festival.",
            "A majority of people in Cambodia take this festival very seriously even if our beliefs and ideas have changed a little bit, thus is still the impact of Buddhist religion which is an integral part of Khmer culture. This year the Pchum Ben Day is expected to be celebrated on October 8 and September 24 is the first day of Kann Ben that everyone has to go to the pagoda to let their ancestors see them in the first day if according to the Khmer’s Belief. I'm also happy that i can meet all my relatives at hometown then we go to the pagoda together to offer food to the monk for giving prayers to our dead ancestors and i wish that day is coming soon!!!"
